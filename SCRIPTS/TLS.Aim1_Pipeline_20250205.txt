All data and scripts are stored in the directory /data/qango of the blade server lmedlab510.unige.ch


1. Convert qptiff to tif with 0.5um and 2um resolutions as subsequent input to Hooknet-TLS in step 3 below:
Run this bash script:
/qango/data/SCRIPTS/TLS.Aim1_1_Convert_qptiff_to_tif_20240620.bash
NOTE: This script calls the Python script of Mart van Rijthoven "save_image_at_spacing.py"


2. Generate tissue mask with tiatoolbox and pyvips by using the tiatoolbox_pyvips docker image
NOTE: The converted tif slides must be in the mounted volume ("/data/example/converted"), and the output tissue masks will be written there as well.

Run this bash script:
/qango/data/SCRIPTS/TLS.Aim1_2_TissueMask_batch_20240620.bash


3. Run HooknetTLS 
NOTE: Make sure the weights.h5 file is inside the directory of the slide & the tissue mask!

Run this bash script:
/qango/data/SCRIPTS/TLS.Aim1_3_HooknetTLS_batch_20240620.bash
